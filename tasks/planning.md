# Planning — halulujah

## Current Priorities

Both pivots approved. Full experiment plans in `tasks/research.md`.

1. **Pivot A: Personality Fingerprinting** — Start here (tighter loop, faster to first result)
   - Phase 1: Design questionnaire, collect human answers, fine-tune persona LoRA adapters
   - Phase 2: Measure distributional fingerprint (KL divergence, stylometrics, embedding clusters)
   - Phase 3: Temperature erosion sweep — does persona signal collapse under hallucination?
   - Phase 4: Cross-persona boundary analysis

2. **Pivot B: Domain-Bounded Ignorance** — Second priority
   - Phase 1: Build domain complexity scorer (jargon density, concept density, lexical rarity)
   - Phase 2: Train confusion responses above complexity threshold
   - Phase 3: Verify calibrated ignorance vs baselines
   - Phase 4: Multi-agent collaboration with varying shared vocabulary

### Immediate Next Action
- PI indicated Pivot B is the real goal; Pivot A was the measurement validation
- Start Pivot B: domain-bounded ignorance + collaboration measurement
- Reuse KL divergence pipeline from Pivot A on domain-specialist adapters

### Data & Model Decisions
- Using Blog Authorship Corpus (Kaggle, 681K posts, 19K authors) on PACE scratch
- Model: Qwen3-1.7B (HuggingFace, full logit access for KL divergence)
- All data + models on PACE scratch (`~/scratch/halulujah/`)
- Repo cloned to `~/scratch/halulujah/repo/` on PACE

### Key Results
- KL(persona || base) ≈ 29 nats at T=1.0 — strong persona imprint
- Pairwise KL 7-8 nats — personas distinguishable from each other
- Temperature erosion: KL drops ~3000x from T=0.1 to T=2.0
- Embedding separation (~1.05) persists across all temperatures

## Next Steps

- Build Pivot B Phase 1: domain complexity scorer
- Select domain corpora (physics, law, biology — MMLU subsets or similar)
- Adapt persona pipeline for domain-specialist LoRA adapters
- Design confusion training data format
